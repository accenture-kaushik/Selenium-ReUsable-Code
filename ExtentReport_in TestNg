Step# 1: We create the instance of ExtentReports class and we pass arguments as path and file name with extension .html. 
As you see above, I have given the link to the path followed by file name as the current class name with .html as the extension.

Step# 2: Once the instance of ExtentReports created and path passed as the argument then we need to create the 
instance of ExtentTest. It holds the method which initiates and end the tests Along with the 
Log status as PASS, FAIL, SKIP, ERROR, FAIL, FATAL and WARNING.

Step# 3:  You need to implement the log status with the help of the instance of ExtentTest. 
You can implement it wherever you are asserting any condition as pass or fail. We will see it further in this tutorial.

Step# 4: At the end, you need to end the test along with flushing and closing of the report. 
It will help you to write the reporting to the designated file name.

Letâ€™s discuss the implementation of Extent Reports in the execution of the test.

Scenario:  We are taking a scenario in which the driver will open the URL and it will capture the title at the home page. 
Now our task is to assert the title through the if-else statement. If the title contains the expected keyword, 
then Extent Reports should print this as pass. Similarly, if the title does not contain the keyword then Extent reports 
should print fail in the report generated.
