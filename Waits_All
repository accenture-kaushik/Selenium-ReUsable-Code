Synchronization - Waits. Sync between page to load and Selenium Actions. Selenium has classes and methods for synchronization;
other tools like protractor has inherent waits. 
2 types of Wait - Static Wait and Dynamic Wait
Static Wait: Thread.Sleep --> The webpage will wait for the specific time mentioned to perform the action. 
Dynamic Wait --> Will wait for a maximum of secs mention. Example: say 20 seconds is mentioned, but webelement is available in 2 secs,
then driver will ignore the rest 18 secs. So, better performance. 

Dynamic Wait - Implicit Wait, Explicit Wait and Fluent Wait

****** Implicit Wait ******** For all instances of webdriver, applied throughout the page
 1-->       driver.manage().timeouts().pageLoadTimeout(20, TimeUnit.SECONDS); Wait for page to load completely for 20 secs max
 2-->       driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(10, TimeUnit.SECONDS);  Wait for each element on all pages to load for 10 secs max
                                                                              This is applied on a driver level on all driver instance
                                                                              

******** Explicit Wait ****** Applies to a specific element. 
WebDriverWait is the class which takes 2 parameters - driver and waiting secs and will wait until ExpectedCondition is satisfied
ExpectedConditions - visibilityOf(<Which WebElement>), elementToBeClickable(<Which WebElement>) etc. 
new WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(ExpectedConditions.visibilityOf(TextBoxToEnter)); --> Will wait for max 10 secs for Text Box to be available
TextBoxToEnter.sendKeys("Kaushik Majumder") --> And then will enter value in the Text Box


Implicitely Wait and Explicitely Wait - Should not be used together. 
Implicitely Wait will wait for the element for (10) secs and then Explicitely wait will wait for another (20) secs. 
So, if a webelment is not visible then total total wait will become (10 + 20) secs. Total sync time will increase. 
ImplicitelyWait we can chnage anytime. In the flow, whichever is the latest implicitely wait that will be implemented.
